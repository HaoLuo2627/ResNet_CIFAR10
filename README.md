# ResNet_CIFAR10
This repository includes an Ipython notebook written by Seyran Khademi as an example document for the reproducibility project report in deep learning course (CS4180) at Delft University of Technology. In this notebook we briefly go over the original ResNet paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385 and explain the steps to reproduce the Table 6 in the paper. 
The Pytorch implementation used in the notebook is based on the adaptation of the code in https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py and https://github.com/akamaster/pytorch_resnet_cifar10 to Jupyter notebook.
