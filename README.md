# ResNet_CIFAR10
This repository includes an Ipython notebook written by Seyran Khademi as an example document for the reproducibility project report in deep learning course (CS4240) at Delft University of Technology. In this notebook we briefly go over the original ResNet paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385 and explain the steps to reproduce the Table 6 in the paper. 
The Pytorch implementation of the ResNet architecture used in the notebook is based on the code in https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/master/torchvision/models/resnet.py and https://github.com/akamaster/pytorch_resnet_cifar10 . However, the experiment setup for training the models has changed for adaptation to Jupyter notebook. The results from the paper has been reproduced successfully with better or comparable results except for the ResNet1202 model, since Google Colab does not support enough (16GB) memory usage on GPU for this experiment.   
We provided our pretrained models in this repository.
